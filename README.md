-> Created a simple spring boot application with RestController giving the detail of an employee with few Junit test cases available.

-> Using the Jenkins pipeline to handle the CI/CD and for that:

  - created  a Jenkinsfile having all the steps to follow inside a script
  - Did sonarqube integration and did the analysis (Used the SonarQube version 6 as it is compatible with JDK 8) 
  - Created a Dockerfile to create a docker image 
  - Pushed that docker image to Docker hub's public repository , link for that is : https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/arshdeepsingh070/devops-home-assignment
